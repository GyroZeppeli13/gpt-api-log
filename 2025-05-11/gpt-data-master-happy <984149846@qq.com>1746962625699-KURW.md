Here's a summary of the changes made to the codebase:

**General Improvements:**

*   **Code Formatting and Readability:** The code has been formatted and cleaned up for better readability and maintainability.
*   **Removed Unnecessary Comments:** Redundant comments and TODOs have been removed to make the code more concise.
*   **Fixed Typos:** Minor typos and inconsistencies in variable names have been corrected.
*   **Refactored Methods:** Some methods have been refactored to improve their structure and functionality.

**Specific Changes:**

*   **Order Timeout Handling:**
    *   A new event `OrderTimeoutCloseMessageEvent` has been introduced to handle order timeout scenarios. This event sends a delayed message to a RocketMQ topic, which triggers the `OrderTimeoutCloseListener`.
    *   The `OrderTimeoutCloseListener` checks if the order is still open and unpaid after 30 minutes and closes it if necessary. It also refunds any coupons used in the order.
    *   The `TimeoutCloseOrderJob` has been modified to serve as a fallback mechanism, periodically checking for orders that need to be closed due to timeouts.
*   **Coupon Management:**
    *   The `updateUserCouponStatus` method in the `UserCouponDao` interface now includes an additional parameter to ensure idempotency when updating coupon status.
    *   The `CouponRepository` has been updated to handle coupon expiration and status updates more efficiently.
*   **OpenAI Repository:**
    *   The `refreshDailyFreeAccessLimit` method now uses synchronous Redis operations instead of asynchronous ones for better consistency.
*   **Event Publishing:**
    *   The `EventPublisher` class has been updated to handle delayed message delivery with a specified delay level.
*   **XXL-Job Registration:**
    *   XXL-Job registration has been moved from `@Scheduled` annotations to the `XxlJob` annotation for better integration and management.
*   **Nacos Configuration:**
    *   The Nacos configuration has been updated to use the correct group ID for property source loading.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The codebase now uses Lombok for reduced boilerplate code.
*   Exception handling has been improved for better error reporting and logging.
*   Logging statements have been added to provide more insight into the application's behavior.

**Overall, these changes aim to improve the stability, reliability, and maintainability of the codebase while addressing specific issues related to order timeout handling and coupon management.**
