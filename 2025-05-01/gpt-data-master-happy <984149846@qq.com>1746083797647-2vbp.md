Based on the provided `git diff` records, here are some review comments and suggestions:

1. **Database Connection Issues**:
   - The logs indicate multiple warnings and errors related to database connection issues, specifically `No operations allowed after connection closed`. This could be due to the `maxLifetime` value being too long, causing connections to be closed by the database server. Consider reducing the `maxLifetime` value for the HikariCP connection pool.

2. **RocketMQ Connection Issues**:
   - There are errors related to RocketMQ connection failures, indicating a problem with connecting to the RocketMQ server. Ensure that the RocketMQ server is running and accessible from the application. Check the network configuration and RocketMQ server logs for more details.

3. **Redis Connection Issues**:
   - The logs show Redis timeout exceptions when sending PING commands. This could be due to network issues or Redis server problems. Verify the Redis server's availability and check the network configuration.

4. **Order Processing Issues**:
   - There are errors related to order processing, specifically `updateOrderStatusDeliverGoodsCount update count is not equal 1`. This suggests that there might be a problem with the database update logic or data consistency. Investigate the database schema, indexes, and the code responsible for updating the order status.

5. **Code Structure and Dependencies**:
   - The `pom.xml` and `application-dev.yml` files have been updated to include RocketMQ dependencies and configurations. Ensure that these changes are compatible with the existing application and that the necessary properties are correctly set.
   - The `OrderRepository` class has been modified to use an `EventPublisher` for sending messages to RocketMQ. This is a good approach for decoupling the application components and handling asynchronous processing.

6. **Error Handling and Logging**:
   - The logs provide detailed information about the errors, which is helpful for debugging. However, consider adding more specific error messages and handling exceptions more gracefully to improve the application's robustness.

7. **Testing and Validation**:
   - After making the changes, thorough testing is necessary to ensure that the application functions correctly and that the issues have been resolved. This includes unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.

Overall, the changes seem to be focused on improving the application's infrastructure and handling asynchronous processing using RocketMQ. However, it is crucial to address the connection issues and ensure that the application is stable and reliable.
